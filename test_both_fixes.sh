echo "✅ Fix 1: Note Editing Mode"
echo "   - Updated buildSystemInstruction to explicitly prefer editing selected notes"
echo "   - Added SELECTED NOTE information to AI context"
echo "   - AI should now edit the selected note instead of creating new ones"
echo ""
echo "✅ Fix 2: Video Generation Process"
echo "   - Enhanced generateVideoScript with detailed 30-second segment requirements"
echo "   - Improved generateManimCode with complete Python template and requirements"
echo "   - Added progress updates during video creation process"
echo "   - Backend will attempt real Manim rendering before creating placeholders"
echo "   - Cleaned up HTML files that were masquerading as MP4s"

echo "🧪 Testing Instructions:"
echo ""
echo "1. 📝 Test Note Editing Fix:"
echo "   a. Go to http://localhost:3001/dashboard"
echo "   b. Select an existing note from the file explorer"
echo "   c. Open AI chatbot and ensure video mode is OFF"
echo "   d. Ask: 'Add a section about quadratic equations'"
echo "   e. ✅ Should edit the selected note, not create a new one"
echo ""
echo "2. 🎥 Test Video Generation Fix:"
echo "   a. Click 'Create Video Lesson' button to turn ON video mode"
echo "   b. Ask: 'create a video about basic calculus limits'"
echo "   c. ✅ Should show proper progress updates through 4 steps"
echo "   d. ✅ Should generate comprehensive script with 30-second segments"
echo "   e. ✅ Should create proper Manim Python code"
echo "   f. ✅ Backend will try real Manim rendering (or create better placeholder)"
echo ""
echo "🎯 Expected Results:"
echo "   - Note editing works with selected notes ✅"
echo "   - Video creation process is more professional ✅"
echo "   - Better error handling and progress feedback ✅"
echo "   - Real video files (if Manim installed) or better placeholders ✅"

echo "🚀 Both servers should be running on:"
echo "   Frontend: http://localhost:3001"
echo "   Backend:  http://localhost:5001"
